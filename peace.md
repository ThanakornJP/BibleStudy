Peace is a promise you keep
Peace when my fear take hold 
Peace when I feel enclosed
Peace when I lose control 
Peace when my thought wage war
Peace when 

All anxiety bows in the presence

Jesus, the  keeper of peace 

Ware is ending over your identity 

War ends in the prince of peace
He may war for our peace
Our war go into rest 

Your word remains truth even my mind wreck havoc 
Jehovah shalom
