# 1. purpose of prophetic ministry {#purpose-of-prophetic-ministry}
- it's about reconciliation 
- `deu28:24`, it shall not rain on the unrighteous
- `matt5:43-45`, transition btw old and new testament.  
- `isa64:6`, `rom3:10`, no one is pure. proof that we need Jesus
- OT judges your work, NT judges Jesus's works
- `acts2:17-19`, pour out for all fresh and generations
- `acts2:20-21`, great and glorous -- NT
- `malachi4:5`, great and terrible -- OT
- `rev3:5`, all names are written in the book of life. He doesn't want us to go to hell

> all receice His grace 

### How to operate in New Testament (NT) prophecy
1. Recognize that you live in the greate and glorious not the great and terrible. You are men of God.

`jer29:11`, God have plans for welfare not for calamity to give you a future and hope. -- this is Heart of God
**!!** `1cor14:24-25`, unbeliver -- 1.convict, 2.secret revealed, 3.face fall down, 4.worship. 

> Kris said he was very acurate sin finder. It is very easy to find gold in the chamber; however, it is hard to find gold among dirt in gold mine bcoz it is mostly dirt and some gold.

2. find the gold inside of people and call it out of them through the prophetic. most gold is covered by dirt.

> sin is not a secret to sinners; but treasure really is 
> inside of every sinner is the image of God that we get to identify and call forth

`1sam9:19`, stay here then I will tell all is in your heart
`1sam10:1-16`, anoint to be king on the next day

3. Call forth the destiny that God has placed inside someone's heart

`1sam10:5-6`, join prophet then you can change to be another man. To be the man that he is supposed to be in the first place.

> Prophecy doesn't just call out the future in someone; it has the ability to transform them into the people they were always meant to be. 

---

# 2. essential parts of prophecy {#essential-parts-of-prophecy}

`1cor12:1-6`, varieties gifts but same spirit. varieties ministries but same Lord. varieties of effects but same God. all things in all person. Paul said this to Corinthians who are based on Greek methodology (based on many gods).

`1cor12:8-11`, various gifts on the same Spirit. -- Paul was teaching about spirit realm not simply the manifestation gifts of the Holy Spirit

1. God wants you to be aware of and informed about spiritual gifts

`1cor14:1`, pursue `love` but especially you'll prophesy.

2. The gifts of the Spirit need to be centered in `love`

> the gifts of the Holy Spirit express the love languages of God

3. we are to earnestly desire spiritual gifts 

`1cor14:3`, speak forth edification, exhortation, and consolation
- edification - to build up
- exhortation - to call someone near to God
> the gift of prophecy or the office of a prophet should never replace your personal relationship with Jesus -- we need both personal relationship and someone edifing 
- consolation - to cheer up, to console, to comfort

4. prophecy convicts us of the glory that we all fell short of 

# 2 Expressions of the Prophetic
1. foretelling - telling the future
2. forth-telling - causing the future

`eze37:1-10`, prophesy over dry bones. graveyard is vein, but prophecy is life

5. prophecy sess dry bones and speaks to them as God sees them

> prophesy bcoz God sees beauty in them though my eyes see ashes. speak forth with love of God. 

### 3 parts of prophecy
1. revelation - what's God saying?
2. interpretation - what does it mean?
3. application - what do I do about what it means?

> When God stops talking, we should too

---

# 3. hearing God's voice & learning God's language {#hearing-god-voice-and-god-language}

> God is multilingual and He is not limited to speaking in one specific way

`john10:27`, my sheeps know my voice

> knowing God's voice is a process that we learn. We learn to recognize God's voice through **experience** and having **constant interaction** with Him. 

1. recognize
2. refer to what you are familiar

`1john4:1`, be testing the voice of God bcoz we can hear other voices and spirits that are not the Spirit of God. Great deception from devils is always. The devil tries to imitate and counterfeit the voice of God in order to deceive us

> have faith that the God's voice to lead us is louder than the others 

### 4 sources of God's voices -- spirit realm
1. human spirit 
- we are the temple for 2 spirits: **human spirit** and **Holy Spirit**
- *Hopefully*, only 2 spirits not other spirits too
- even though our spirit thinks like His Spirit bcoz we were redeemed, but it is not the same as Holy Spirit
2. Holy Spirit
3. evil spirits
4. angels

> we need discernment to recognize what voice is speaking to us

### His Primary language
1. visions
1.1 vision of the mind -- closed your eyes
1.2 open visions -- opened eyes
2. dreams -- not all dreams are from God
3. angels
4. trances -- in a vision, you are awared of surrounding. Trances is completely unawared of surrounding 
5. discerning of spirit -- ability to identify/segregate the source of voice. whatever bother them bothers me

> devil is not an inventor/creator; he is a copier

> our goal is to be multilingual of His voice

--- 

# 4. How to judge & evaluage prophetic words {#evaluate-prophetic-words}

`1the5:19-21`, do not despise prophetic utterance but **examine everything** carefully and hold fast to what is good

`1cor14:29`, let 2 or 3 prophets speak and let others pass 

### Keys to evaluating a prophetic word
1. identify the source of the prophetic word

> gift of discerning of spirits is used to identify the source. Prophecy is based upon the gift of discerning 

- OT, High accountability of prophets
    - if he's right, there is power of the Word -- everyone must obey otherwise getting punished
    - if he's wrong when time goes by, he got stoned even in their early day of being prophet
- NT, all believers can discern and evaluate the source of the word. It doesn't have to rely on time

> Even Paul didn't get the prophetic words exactly right, and they won't call false prophet.

`act21:10-11`, wrong detail while Paul was going to Rome
`act27,28:1-10`, wrong detail while Paul was on the ship

2. develop a refuse gate for inaccurate prophetic words. Flush and go on.

- you need to have sense of rejection for words like cause fear, reduce you, put you in confinement, call you the name that God doesn't call you. Don't be so sensitive. Don't let them hurt you on the outside

> Words have no power unless we believe them

3. evaluate the characteristics of prophetic word and what is products in your life

### How to judge
1. make sure the prophetic word is not anti-Biblical. It can be Biblical and extra Biblical

- there are Biblical, anti-Biblical, and extra-Biblical.
- pharisee know the word of God, but they don't know the word of God. 

> it takes both Bible and Holy Spirit to equal truth.

2. your spirit needs to bear witness to prophetic word

- sometimes, sth offended your mind came from your spirit. Sometimes, your mind may be offended by a prophetic word that your spirit receives and welcomes as accurate.

> Don't judge prophetic words with my mind but with my spirit 

---

# 5. receiving & ministering in the gift of prophecy {#receive-and-minister-in-the-prophetic-gift}

gift = you don't have to work for it

1. we receive the gifts of th Spirit through **asking** and **impartation** not so much through articulation

- there must be sth I know that I don't know because you havn't got impartation
- five fold ministry is not the gift of the Spirit but the gift of Christ. There are 5 favours.


`rom1:11`, Paul longs for impartation for others. Sth havnt yet established because it ain't imparted
`heb6:1-2`, lay on the hand 
`eph4:7`, to each one of us **grace** was given according to Christ's gifts
`eph4:11-13`, we receive for service
`rom12:6`, having the gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us. Exercise them accordingly.
`matt10:41`, receiving reward (grace)

> each of us are given **gifts**
> gifts are given according to **grace** (grace has favour)
> we use the gifts in proportion to how much **faith** we have. We used container (faith) to hold his grace.
> a gift of Christs equips the saints to do the **work of service**. 

- grace you receive determines the gifts you receive.grace <> gifts. Pastor lays hand on me for **pastoral grace** not gift. 
- grace = operational power of God. grace pulls us out of darkness. The ability to do. Receiving prophet grace make you prophetic.  


### Key to receiving the grace to activate a gift
receive from someone who is already flowing in that gift. the more you give, the more you receive

### Key to activating and ministering in prophetic ministry
1. be faithful to use what you already have
- Faithful on what you have. Exercise all talents you have until He considers whether you should have more.
2. you don't have to be deep to be powerful
- normal (human) words is service. God will conduct prophetical manifestation in our sentence Himself. 
- Presumably, our word is red and His grace is blue. Blue is the ability to make that red happen. And, the receivers will get that blue in our red. Only blue can transform anyone not the red
3. prophesy in faith under the influence of God's grace

---

# 6. prophetic etiquette (good manners/protocol) {#prophetic-etiquette}
`1cor14:32`, spirit of prophet is subject to prophet
- you can manage yourself even in the Holy Spirit 

1. manage yourself when you receive a prophetic word
- you have the ability to control
- you are responsible for your actions
> He did everything for us and we can just neglect His grace because of freedom He gives 

2. just because you feel/sense God's anointing, it doesn't mean you need to immediately respond and react
- we learn to move into gifts of the Spirit
- we need gifts and to be anointed

3. when you feel God's presence and hear Him speak, you have a responsibility to pastor yourself.
`1cor14:40`, let all things be done **decently** (conforming with generally accepted standard of respectable) and **in order**

> right word with the right season

- find right protocol to release prophetic word
- responsible to manage yourself towards outcome

### Core values for prophetic minitry
1. Prophetic ministry should be redemptive
- minister to bring lost children back home

2. Don't prophesy when you are angry
- prophecy /ˈpräfəsē/
- prophesy /ˈpräfəˌsī/

3. Don't prophesy about a subject that you angry about
- Don't mention "God said it". It's you receiving and interpretating.

4. Prophecy should not be a platform for our personal beliefs
5. Prophecy is not a substitute for **discipleship**
- relationship gets us to minister not only just prophecy. We do everything with love.

6. You don't have to say "Thus says the Lord" for a word to be prophetic

7. You are not just expressing the word of the Lord; you are also communicating the **tone** of the Lord

`prov18:21`, death and life are in the power of the tongue

8. be careful when sharing prophetic **warnings**
9. you are not qualified to deliver prophetic **judgements**; only God judges
- warn with love 
- warn aggressively might be caused by fact that you feeling unsafe
- we don't do judgement
- judgement is consequence for your behaviour

> you can tell a lot about people by the way they prophesy

---

# 7. false prophets {#false-prophet}

`1john4:1`, beloved, do not believe every spirit but **test the spirits** to see whether they are from God, because **many false prophets have gone out** into the world

1. Example #1: Spirit of divinition

`acts16:16-21`, woman said these are the men of God
- false prophets don't always have bad information they have the wrong spirit
- devil will tell you the truth if it can destruct/destroy you

2. Example #2: Calling of God. One who is prophetically gifted, but walks away from God

`rom11:29`, the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable **!!**

### 3 Things that make a ministry
1. the call: gives identity
2. the gifts: gives ability
3. the anointing: gives purpose; sth to do

- the anointing ebbs and flows depending upon your relationship with the Holy Spirit
`isa61:1`, the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me

- office of the prophet is something **I am**. the gift of a prophecy is something **I do**. you always have your identity and gifts God gives them for you no matter where you go even you turn away from God. However, if you choose to walk away from God, who is gonna anoint you. If you ain't anointed, what purposes you can utilize those gifts, where you can be who you really are.
- when removed from God, one's prophetic gifting can be used by the demonic realm. Right gifts, but wrong unity.
- Jesus warns us about false prophets because there are also real ones. we need to discern the differences between the two

`matt7:15`, beware of false prophets who come in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
`matt7:16-23`, **you will know them by their fruits**. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles. **Good tree cannot bear bad fruit and likewise**. Bad tree will be cut down eventually because they practice lawliness.
`matt7:24`, Therefore, to everyone who **hears these words of mine and acts on them** is the ones who build their houses on the rock
`matt7:25`, Thise house did not fall against devestration
- Do they know the Lord? Does the Lord know them?
- keeping the law = listening to and obeying God
- Prophet listen and act = lawfulness
- False prophets listen, but don't act = lawliness
    - it is not law of Moses, but the law of the Spirit
    - they are gifted, but not being led by the Spirit
    - they build their house on sand

3. Example #3: People who are prophetically gifted, but they do not follow Jesus.
4. Example #4: People who entire ministries around select, isolated Scripture verses that are taken out of context
- instead of full counsel of God, they pick only a few fractioned verses in their ministries
- appear to be good

### 5 Tests of a false prophet
1. false prophets don't believe in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ
`1john4:2`, 
2. false prophets don't listen to anyone. 
`1john2:19`, 
- is **Hyper-spiritual** 
- False prophet claims that God tells them everything
- Because of afraid of people, they tryna control people
3. false prophets need to be noticed
- tryna draw people to themselves
4. false prophets use fear to motivate people
- ex. Lord told me sth about you but I can't tell you. Expressing more powerful over other people
5. false prophets are not in covenat relationships with other people
- by living in fellowship with one another, we maintain accountability and protection from deception

> If you don't have s1n you can trust more than yourself, then you can get out of deception. Since, the nature of deception is you don't know you were deceived

- we need leaders in our lives that we trust more than we trust ourselves

---

# 8. keys to practicing prophecy {#key-to-practicing-prophecy}
new beginning for practicing prophecy

> the more you use your gifts, the better you get at it; practice how to move with the Holy Spirit

`1tim4:14-15`, do not neglect the spiritual gift within you; **take pains with these things**; **be absorbed in them** so that your progress will be evident to all
- absorb in the gift the Lord giving you
- labor intensely in the area of your gift
- you have to have a relationship

`2tim1:6-7`, I remind you to **stir up the gift of God** which is in you
- pass your fear and fully alive in your gifts
- To grow in our gift, we have to deal with our fears. 

> when you start moving in your gift, you are going beyond what is comfortable. If you are not run into evil once for a while; it is you going the same way

`philippians4:9`, things you hav learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things and God of peace will be with you    
`heb5:14`, solid food is for the mature who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil
`2pet1:10`, be all the more dilligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble

### Practical steps to activating the prophetic in your life 
1. start prophesy **your day**
- get up in the morning; ask Holy Spirit "tell me sth about my day that I wouldn't know the other way"
- ask the Lord to see someone with specfic trait or clothing during the day

> don't focus on Wow somebody, but pay attention to relationship. So make it more natural sounded to someone you're about to encourage

2. practice giving **Words of Knowledge**
- info. you got from Holy Spirit that is currently true
- immediately judge ex. Lord gives name, age, place, etc.
- diff. from prophecy 
- get used to His voice

> Holy Spirit helps me to learn your voice.
> If you got Him right, then start building relationship and prophesy over them.

3. prophesy over each other in groups and give constructive feedback
- put somebody in the middle (who know how to flush - they need how to handle the mistake), and prophesy over them. Then, give them **specific prophetical words and words of knowledge** so that they can judge
- good feedback is a must

> it's not practice makes perfect
> it's perfect practice makes perfect

> don't wait until you feel anointed; gifts are always available.
> get out and touch people.

# 9. Power of prophetic declaration part 1 {#power-of-prophetic-declaration-1}

**Power of sound**
- God used the sound of His voice to create eveything that exists
- all existing around us is in form of prophecy

`prov18:21`, power of life and death is **in the tongue** and those who love it will eat the fruit of it
`jam3:1-12`, who control your tongue control your own being
`prov15:4`, soothing tongue is a tree of life

### 2 ways that we resonates with what is spoken
1. air conduction - ears and brain. Ear hears then brain can process
2. bone conduction - bones, nervous, and brain. they vibrate and resonates the sound

When you speak, you bones actually vibrate with what you say
Your brain intepretes the vibration of your bones
Your bones were made to vibrate or resonate

> when you agree with what they said to you, your bones will be affected by death or life they spoke

`gen1:1-3`, Initially, it is formless. Holy Spirit hovers the deep. Let there be light, then there was light
> Within these 3 verses, we see God Father, Holy Spirit and the Son.


### 3 forces matter for something needed to exist
1. nuclear forces - atomic particle
`gen1:1`, particle matter; substance God would use to form everything in Heaven and Earth. Nuclear particle to form  everything but He didn't shape it yet (not stir up yet)

2. gravtiational forces - hold those things together
In Hebrew `rachaphH7367`, Holy Spirit vibrates to energize particles to release gravitational forces to pull them together

3. electromagnetic forces - define shape with the mass
`joh1:1-3`, in the beginning, the Word was with God. the Word was God. Through Him all things were made. Jesus is the Word.
Then, Jesus, the Word, release the electromagnetic forces "let the light realm exists"

### Createive force behind your tongue. Sound can form the shape.
- Ernest, the study of sand on the plate was formed upon the given sound 
- Rueben's tube, the study of fire on the tupe was senstive to given sound 


### 3 terms to get to secret of apostle realm and power of prophetic declaration
1. frequency - measurement of the speed at which matter vibrates. 
- It's always about particles and its vibration. 
- Everything in the universe has a vibration and frequency is the measurement of that vibration

2. resonance - prologation or intensification of a sound so that it can be heard, measured or detected
- resonate ~ re-sound
- everything has sound(vibrate) but not resonate or long enough so that you can hear it.

3. entrainment - tendency of 2 oscillating bodies of the same frequency to lock into phase so that they vibrate together
- Christiaan Huygens, the study of 2 pendulum clocks
- when 2 things are on the same frequency, they will lock into phase and vibrate together = entrainment
- the study of 3 metronomes. When they are close enough, they are locked up in sync (same freq). When one is pull away, then they are out-of-sync

`matt18:19`, Again, truly I tell you that if 2 of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in Heaven

> The power of `entrainment` is the power of prophetic declaration

--- 

# 10. Power of prophetic declaration part 2 {#power-of-prophetic-declaration-2}

- take dominant of vibration on material to resonate it 
- take much higher frequency on material's vibration to break it
- you can't bend the glass with pressure but you can bend it with the voice

`jos6:1-27`, the collapse of the wall of Jericho. They wouldn't allow to speak for 6 days. The only they would make is the sound of obidience. 

`matt18:19`, Again, truly I tell you that if 2 of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in Heaven
`joh15:7`, if you abide in me and my words abide in you, you can ask whatever you will and it will be done for you.

> If your heart resonates on Father's frequency and His words resonates within you, then when you speak, the **universe responds as it is His voice**. When you agree with what He said, you are insync with His frequency

`heb6:18`, God did this so that by 2 unchangable things in which it is impossible for God to lie
- It is **scientifically possible** for God to lie
    - it is because when God says sth even though it wasn't true a second ago, all creation is scrumble to take on the shape what He just said. 
    - Because He, God, is the frequency create it
    - There is vibration at the center of all matters, and that's vibration is the voice of Jesus Christ.
    - If the voice shape it
    - `col1:16-17`,in Him all things were created and hold together 
    - everything responds to what He just said

> Prophecy is the entrainment in Heaven
> Prophet is to release **creative forces of the creator** like Father and child. 

### Note
1. Everything in the universe has a FREQUENCY
2. Every FREQUENCY makes a SOUND! 
3. ENTRAINMENT with that FREQUENCY release the power to reshape or destroy

> God gives the power of life and death on your tongue
> **!!** when you resonate on the dominant frequency of Heaven, when you make a sound He makes, then nothing will be impossible to you because the universe will respond to your voice just like His voice. It is when you are in entrainment with Him. If you abide in Him, and His word abide in you, ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you

> Sometimes you don't have to fully understand before you agree with. Just put your faith upfront.
> **!!** If I can get my faith out in front of me, and embrace it, then I start the acceleration of entrainment that begins to release the realm of the impossible

---

# 11. Metron, three spheres of influences part 1 {#sphere-of-influence-1}
every prophet has their own sphere of influence 

> prophet always has a mission and a metron (measurement / sphere of influence)
- `prophetic input` - receive thru the entrainment with Him
- `apostolic output` - find your output thru understanding your metron

### 3 measure that affect your prophetic gift
1. `eph4:7`, measure of the **gift** of Christ 
- size of your gift 
- how much of the grace is on your gift? 
- the power of God that awakes the fullness of God in specific way of your life
- 
2. `rom12:3,6`, measure of your **faith**
- not based on how much faith you have(possess), but on **how much you can believe** for and actually see occur or activate

> **!** The size of the gift must pass through the funnel of your faith

> what you're calling **"Sphere of Influence"** is actually "Fear of Influence". It is because you don't have faith for that. So, we **don't treat Sphere of Influence as a box** that keeps us only for those surround us.

3. `2cor10:13`, meansure of your **rule** (sphere of influence)
> **!** your gifts work everywhere on everyone, but it works best somewhere on someone
- you can improve your gifts (clarity, precision, impact, etc.) around your sphere of influence.
- Link prophetic input with apostolic output, from there; it creates great impact

###### 3 types of rules
1. Demographic - a face 
- people group that you are assigned to for His manifestation to take place
- we all have diff. assignment

2. Geographic - a place
- it could be workplace, finance, etc.
- you don't have authority everywhere
- you do have authority somewhere
- read the sign and know what to do

3. Sociographic - a grace
- subgroup within society shares common and specific interest
- place where it can pull out **my calling** because the commonality that I was created for
- anywhere within one of the circles of your spheres of influence you will see **unusal favor, authority and influence**

> your gifts will get exponentially greater impact respecting the sphere of influence than what you have passion for without being assigned for. It is your assignment. 
- `rom9:3-4`, `rom11:13` , Paul was called for Gentiles not for Jews
- `matt15:24`, Jesus and lost sheep of Israel. Even Jesus, our Saviour, **confined His activities to the area of His assignment**
- `2cor10:13`, I will confine my boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to me, a sphere that also includes you. God will expand my sphere. 

### How do you expand your sphere of influence 
How do you expand your sphere of influence by **being faithful in the little things** in the one that you currently have

`luk19:17`, because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over 10 cities

--- 

# 12. Finding your sphere of influence part 2 {#sphere-of-influence-2}

### 2 ways to find sphere of influence
1. assigned 
- where God speaks directly to a specific mission
- sth leap inside of you
- we all receive demographic call
- assigned sphere of influence can come to you via **prayer, scripture, or your prophetic words**

`1tim1:18`, keeping with the prophecies once made about you so that by following them you may **fight the good fight of faith**
- to listen to the military campaign/ formulate the strategy
- you need to strategize on prophetical words

> when you realize you apostolic mission in your prophetic words, then you start **enlisting the angelic hosts** on your behalf

> Angel are more excited to hear you sing revelation than you want to hear them sing. Because, when you **sing with revelation**, then they get assignments

2. observed 
- where you gather the evidence that defines your sphere

`prov4:7`, the beginning of **wisdom** is this: Get wisdom! Though it cost all you have, **get understanding**

### Good Idea vs God Idea
### 4 place to meet Wisdom
`prov8:1`, Does not **wisdom call out**? Does not understanding raise her voice? At the **highest point** along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand; beside the gate leading into the city, at the entrance, she cries aloud

1. High point of your life (on the height)
- the best moment in the game not the whole game
- retrospect your past **that it is life**, then you see prospect of sphere of influence
- looking back at your **highlight real** of 
    - where you have had favor, authority, and influence, 
    - where you have had breakthrough, 
    - where your gift has accelerated, 
    - you will **get the wisdom to know where you ought to be**

`heb11`, never doubt even once
`phi4:8`, if anything (true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable) is excellent or praiseworthy -- think about such things
- reticular activator = where once you've seen sth, you have a greater ability to see it in other places
- you have eyes to see because of the point of focus
`heb10:17`, their sins and lawless deeds will remember no more
- Why God is so easy to forget sin, 
    - of course, it is becasue of blood of Jesus
    - but, He is never sin/failed
        - so He doesn't have reticular activator on Him
        - because He has never done sin
    - Thus, God does remember the cherish moments with you

> Only Good thing, only life, this is how I, God, think

2. Along the way speaks to recurring opportunities, gifts and graces
- what keep coming to you over and over again
- that would lead you to imparting to next generations

3. Where the paths meets speak of the best decisions you have made 
- the best decision you've ever made -- find wisdom 

4. Beside the gates speaks of open doors and opportunities
- the place you have favor

> A retrospective look across the highlights of your life with Holy Spirit can give you the prospect of what you are supposed to do and where you should be

> Dan, Part of prophet, I'm a STRATEGIST (Idea factory); Im not supposed to do all these ideas; im just collecting and give them away to people.

### Wisdom of sustainability in 3 Tests
1. pay attention to your recurring ideas and imaginations
- ones that you can't get rid of

2. pay attention to your burderns and what brings you to tears
- what when left undeone bothers/challenges you, or makes you think, "This could be done so much better"

> whenever you have **unexpected tears** in your eyes, pay close attention, they are not only tell you the secret who you are but more often than not the mystery where you have come from, and summoning you where you should go next. 
- it usually tells you where you should be

3. pay attention to your gifts and callings
- shift from gifts to callings

> The **most sustainable things** you will ever do will hit your mind, your heart, and spirit. **Cross-section** between your mind, your soul, and spirit reveals somethings that you can **give your whole self to**

# 13: Apostles and Prophets {#apostle-and-prophet}
- prophet is mentioned in the bible more than all the other 5-fold gifts put together

`eph2:20`, having been build on the foundation of the apostile and prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone.

> prophetic vision **without apostolic service/mission** often gets corrupt. 
- whenever you have intake more than the output, you get corrupted on your stack
- If your vision doesn't have apostolic mission, then your gift is not yet operating in love bcoz it doesn't serve anybody
- your **gifts without service** can never equal love
- your gifts are not for us, but for the weary ones

> apostolic mandate is not how many times can earthlings go to heaven, but how much of heaven can we release on the earth
- if you are going to heaven on regular basis without bringing back portion, you should quit going
- God will meet your measure of your faith not self-centered 
- if you're going to heaven for personal experience or encountering without taking back solution, transformation, etc., then you do it for yourself and that is abuse on prophetic grace on your life
- service should be trackable and measurable. prophecy must be judged. if it is not measured, then you havn't prophesied yet

> Don't prophesy things too far away
> Don't give someone a word that you would not be willing to walk through with them
`john16:12`, I still have many things to say to you, but you **cannot bear them now**
- prophesy only what they can only bear

### Prophet identification method
1. internal call
`Dan`, I have encountered Jesus with 3 angels every year telling him what is going on.

2. external call
`Dan`, I believe that a prophets external call should com from s1n who is in the office if apostle or prophet not from the ministry team

3. received in the office
`2kin2:14-18`, Elisha says no after getting anointed.
- Elisha doesn't act as a prophet right after Elijah anointed him 
- there is process even after the incredible manifestation or anointing until all know that the last season is really gone. 

4. others 
`1kin19:16-19`, anoint **Elisha** based on succession plan without laying hands, pouring oils, or stuff like that. He just **threw his mental over** and walked away
`1kin19:21`, Elisha responds with love and serve **Elijah**. He has everything from heaven since he was anointed but he chose to serve a little longer with Elijah.
