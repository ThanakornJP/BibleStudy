# Main session 1 {#main-session-1}
- prophetic company
- core value here is not to convince
- `Kris`, he didn't start church somewhere bcoz he wants to be him here in bethel. He very much loves Bill. He has been doing spiritual consulting. I do what I do not taking side when serving political parties. 
- Joseph, Daniel, Esther -- have favour of the king
    - Daniel fell in love with the king who hasn't yet known God and serve him. 
    - **Can you love the one who you don't agree with?**
    - Ask yourself, how well do you love those who God has required of you to pray for or prophecy about

- don't expect s1n to be perfect
- build a team/community
- God doesn't take sin (that tree) bcoz love requires **free will** 
- Kris prophesied over Trumph to be the president for 2 consecutive terms.
    - He stepped upfront and apologized for the mistake on 2nd term
    - be led by **Spirit pressure** not public pressure
    - if afraid prophesying in public, submit and follow to the Holy Spirit  
    - it's okay to get Him wrong, admit it and don't yield your gifts to satan.


### Prophetic protocol
1. `1cor14`,`1the4:19` don't quench gifts and despise the Spirit utterance, but examine everything and hold fast to everything to what is good.
- when you received His Spirit, you're righteous.

- `In old testament` the only way to test is to see prophecy come to past
- Anyway, we can identify the source of prophecy bcoz God cannot lie

### False prophetic
1. `act16`, 
2. `rom`, gifted but not anointed 
3. intentionally deceived people (not the outcome) - never obey the Word = lawlessness though they perform miracles -- heart problem
4. `1jon4`
5. can't be under leadership; isolate themselves.
6. doesn't LOVE people
7. move people in fear (crisis)

### key takeaway
- develop and deploy
- run prophetic community
- encourage people
- be humble and minister
- enemies always use our gifts to attack us 
    - `2cor10`, watch out thoughts, speculation (what if), and other negative thoughts carefully 
        - fear is misfit faith  
        - insomnia, anxiety, irrational thought
        - rash (caused by anxiety)
        - spirit of **adoption** vs spirit of **abandon** 

`I will see every promise and prophecy come to pass in your name, Jesus. Your promises never fail`

### prophetic reformation
- be prophetic reformer 
- to reveal Jesus in fresh ways
- transform 
- it's Father pouring new things
- creature 360 that see His throne perfectly

    - **Jeremiah**
    - **Daniel**
    - **Esther**
    - **Moses** see burning bush
2. what does it mean?
3. comfort, encouragement, edifice people

`Practice`: look around and see what is catching your eyes? (90s)
- don't disqualify if you just received words instantly
- you may pray and speak in tongue 

`rom1:20`, has been clearly seen

### Kris - New testament theme 
`psa29`, `deu`, `jos`, love neighbor, hate enemies. I hate who you hate
`matt5:43`, transition -- new testament. love your neighbor and hate your enemies
- Elijah - stop the rain -- the curse on the land
- Elijah - call down the fire

### ---
`luk22:19`, last sappher -- here is my body and blood
`rom5:19`, 
`heb9:16`, valid covenant
`heb8:10-12`, He make old testament obsolete. Now, I will be your God. 

### ---
`isa61`, Messiah, the kingship appearance. 
old and new. 
`1cor`, New covenant breaks up into **last day and last days**
`mal`, **great and terrible**
`mal4:5`, before terrible day
`act22:19`, peter began preaching **last day**: **great and glorious** come. Moon turned red = Jesus died -- based on Joseph's dream interpretation
`joh16`, World will be saved through Him, Jesus
`joh5:22`, 
`joh12:28`, Jesus died on the cross to judge the enemies not people
`2cor`, **ministry of reconciliation not judgement**. ability to forgive people's sin.   
- John, his **prophetic decoration** is the last prophet in old testament. He died losing his head. God turns our heart to new testament prophet. 
- we all deserve death bcoz of sin; we are refuge
- Jesus created justice -- all sins in the world came to Jesus when He died on the cross -- God release mercy to the world bcoz He doesn't have to die -- thus, God can release His grace to unworthy
- You are saved by grace not your work
- **last days** = grace and glorious period for whoever say His name; Sign = He will pour His Spirit in all flesh and everyone will know His name
- **last day** = day of judgement
- warning <> judgement
- restore your family

> God doesn't have to create judgement to create justice (and mercy consequently) bcoz of the crucification.

> when you judge people, you judge yourself


### Q&A
1. what is practical step to step out of O.T into N.T
- Kris, to love people is the best way
- `rom13`, free will; watch your opinion for governor (political parties); not judge people motive
- xxx, grace is scanless and stick with gospel
- `1cor3`, praticing love

2. how to prophesy when you discern bad things
- Dan, look the treasure
    - start with assumption (question)
    - ex. how to minister the one who has impure thought
        - pay attention to the root God shows you: form of control not form of lust
- Kris, use dicipleship 
    - we don't justice for our prophetic decoration ; however, it doesn't mean we can't use that tool for people

3. Does God use sickness and trial to build our character
- Kris, trial from God is only one I want to embrace. You can't count your stupid decision
- xx, affliction is not part of His tool; Jesus is the healer.

> Heaven
1th heaven - Earth
2nd heaven - Hell
3rd heaven - Realm of God

4. 

5. Is prophesying sin required while judgement is not right? If not, why does God give us the ability to discern people's sin?
- Dan, it is training your eyes to see what God sees
- Kris, once we receive Jesus, we have no reason to sin; our nature is transformed
- **sense of compeling vision** -- create forward momentum
- **repent** - default sin
- xxx, dicerning sin is not for calling sin out but drawing them near with love and help walk them through. Remind instead of judge. Find solution and help them.

> make sure you don't incorporate with spirit of condemnation(point fingure) and conviction()

# Main session 4 {#main-session-4}

### He impresses us not the gifts
- don't lose your joy while exercising your gifts bcoz gifts is enjoyment. Otherwise, take a break.
- `1cor12`: eagerly desire
- No Bill Johnson represented God the Father and Kris represented His gift. God wanted to talk to Ben not to his gift
- Kris was the gift and God doesn’t want to talk to your gift, He is impress with you!!!
- So good especially those of us who are not as developed as other prophets.  Yes we prophesized from a strong identity not for one..  Your identity is in Christ (my addition)
- Stop judging things like we knew

> We don’t act for identity but from Identity

> prophet - being; prophecy - doing; both important

> When you focus on the gift people sees you only; When we take Holy Spirit form the gift thats when people just see us

### how to represent gift of the gift
- if I abide in Him, I bear much fruits
- If you don’t use your gift you’ll lose it, not true
- The prophetic looks like you!
- God is not looking for clones is looking for you
- have in mature thru **practice and repetition**
- Yes it was a traumatic season...….but it was good to be stripped of your positions for a time to be with  Papa God in the secret place.

> know your audience when you prophesy; speak their language not churchy language

> gift and calling is irrevocable 

> fruit of Holy Spirit is who he is 

> Key: Knowing you identity; Walking from your strong identity not for one

- Office of Prophet
    - Learn how to be with people process
    - Not afraid of the process of the people we are Fathering

> all interpretation belongs to God

- `1the2:1-14`, kingdom family
    - As Father encouraging you, comforting you and urging you
    - fatherhood is uniquely connected with prophet
    - **inspire** them to be who they are in keeping prophetic words in their lives **not tell** them what to do
    - **Healthy family** perpetuate healthy families; Restore what is established in you

- **clean concience** 
    - God wants to shift our concience to be like how God thinks thru our true identity 
    - study the instructions and the words spoken over our life
    - I can’t afford to have a though about myself that God doesn’t have about me

> Prophet make space for the impossibilities to be processed; Infiniti solutions Jesus paid for them


> You are not limited to just one; God chooses the Prophet not our choice

### Prophecy
- gift of Holy Spirit
- sth you do
- comfort, edify, encourage
- his word itself is a gift
- service gift
- gift for life

### Prophet 
- gift of Christ
- sth you are
- direct, correct, inspire, warn, equip
- he himself is a gift
- part of 5 fold team
- calling for life

> we declare cancer free zone in Jesus's name

# Main session 9 {#main-session-9}

### How to interconnect with officer
- `rom13:1`, governor, no authority except that which God has established
- `rom13:1-5`, political leaders/governor/officer are entitled because God allows them to. Do not rebel coz their swords are justice 
- Thus, when you elect governor, it isn't you electing the pastor

Operate by Love or **Fear**
- Fear relates to punishment
- perfect Love casts out fear
    - love requires **free will**
    - sanctify from inside out; you can't freely harm anyone
    - if you **can't self control from the inside**, God will control you from the outside, officer, to keep you from doing evil.
    
> To remember Government rules with a **rod**, pastors rule with a **shepherds rod**

> Don't try chirstianize them more than kingdomize them

> LGBT is also region.

> Church has culture; bringing everyone to know Jesus. Treat them all the same no matter they are righteous or unrighteous. it's **equality**

> It's you job to watch your clock not theirs.

> you may get killed by association anyway. For instance, you took a picture with celeb. There might be some supporters and haters who will judge you based on your association 

> we're falling for our team not political party; we don't take side in the world except the kingdom of God

### Differences
1. word of knowledge - under love protocol to open someone's mind/faith gate
2. prophecy - strengthen, comfort,

# Main session 10 {#main-session-10}

> There is no gift without Spirit
There is no life wuthout Spirit
There is sustainable performance without Spirit

# Main session 11 {#main-session-11}
Prophet and Family

- don't buy idea of greater level, greater devil coz that's devil attacking
    - don't exalt yourself
    - Rather, big God, little devil
    - be humble, Greater levels--greater provision -- greater protection.

1. your family should get benefit from your calling 
    `jam10:23`, prohet is friendship of God
    `gen20:7`, God protects the prophet; God protects Abraham's wife
    `amos3:7`, 
    `Romans 14:17`, 
2. your house should be house of fun not religios
3. don't do prophesy in fatherhood/motherhood

    - listen from the heart not head
    - `prov18:2` 
    - ask clarification 
    - communicate is important to the kids
    - don't marry the church; your wife isn't Rachael and church isn't Leah
6. don't fight before your kids without coming back in love
    - ex. if you yield your wife before kids, they will learn it's alright to do so. Apologize your wife and ask your kids forgiveness as well
    - forgiveness brings us back to pentacos; it's repentant
7. teach how to manage apetite
    - feed everything they need to keep him full
    - ex. sexual desire - preTeen isn't wrong coz they don't really get consequences. stay connected and get along with your kids

> nobody makes your mad, mad is in you; trial just reveals mad in you

### How Joseph interprets dreams
`gen15:1`, Joseph didn't get into school but he was raise in the supernatural family, a dreamer; it seems his second nature.

### How to raise your kids
1. value their dream
    - pray for them before going bed
    - ask them what dreams they might have 
2. expect them to hear God
    - ex. what Jesus just said since He walked in to the room
    - create expectation that they can hear God whenever they want
3. demonstrate God and distinguish devil at home
    - teach them how to prophesy at home
4. value worship
5. share supernatural to your kids
6. find mentor for kids 
    - you might not be spiritual father to your kids

    - contextualize - 
    - weaponize - get them good
8. reopen faith gate/gifts when season comes 
    - gifts are irrevocable

# Main session 12 {#main-session-12}
Prophet and Community

- protestor = stay outside
- **reformer** = get inside and look for what's good to build better

### Let's get DNA matched 
1. build the community not just celebrity 
    - not just prophetic church but **the world**
> Lord, expand your prayer towards your king, governor, officer who are oppressed by demons

2. drive prophetic word
    - those strange words will shake the world 
    - that might make you more weird 
    - but if you stand for Him, He will make you majority instead
> new testament, new covenant of the prophetic. Jesus said He didn't come to abolish the old but fulfil, and also establish new.
    - distribute the kingdom of God; the citizenship; the benefit of the kingdom
3. mine good/gold 
    - let's **build innovation/creativity**; **resolve problem** 
        - access/recognize His realm to receive solution/wisdom/knowledge
        - `cor2`
        - `Habakkuk 2`, I will stand my watch And set myself on the rampart, And watch to see what He will say to me, And what I will answer when I am corrected. The Just Live by Faith 2 Then the Lord answered me and said:
        - be **solutionary**
    - God's plan is to bring people to Him, into repentant, to receive grace and safe.
    - love sign and wonder more than sermon
    - let's **build the kingdom** not collapse the old
    - take just problems in my city and ask God for solution

> there are more prophetic people than any time before; it's wine from Lord where it needs wineskin

> no testimony without test; no breakthrough without the wall

> be prophet that amplifies the solution not complaint 

> `Isaiah` has solutions for kingdom not the church idea.
- God starts with prophetic decoration incorporating with these prophets
- His prophets will prophesy how to live in the kingdom, in the future.
- `prov24:3`, Wise people are builders[a]— they build families, businesses, communities. And through intelligence and insight their enterprises are established and endure. Because of their skilled leadership, the hearts[b] of people are filled with the treasures of wisdom and the pleasures of spiritual wealth.

> Don't dream/prayer small; God's awaiting for you to expand/encourage to ask bigger for His Kingdom

### Kris prophecy
1. rockership sending out
- what's the moon? -- it's reformation
- what's weight left? 

2. Road runner died 
- when we keep it within church, it's gonna die 
- start evagelitical ministry

### Kingdom Practice
- think like me, kingdomnization, when you are in my metron ex. you get paid by me

# The Good Fight: a Prophetic Processing Workshop by Michelle Deuz {#prophetic-processing-workshop}

- **code: sotp100**
- it is a tool; mining people mind.
- it takes time and dirty
- look over **prophetic words** and put **mindset** the end of each of them; Those words wont get fulfilled until you change/turn yourself towards those mindset


### Step
1. jot down prophetic words
2. check mindset if it fits those words 
3. deep dive into your identity
    - identity and implied identity
    - craft identity statement ex. i'm .....
    - false identity will get peeled 
    - socialise with your true identity
4. Voice of God is powerful
    - say "kingdom of God is activated through my voice", Amen
    - say "I abide in the identity of Christ in us", Amen
5. **Absolute vs Conditional** promises
    - look through the prophetic words; segregate absolute promise from what is conditional 
    - `gen12:2-3`, God said to Abraham "I will ..."
    - `gen28`, God said to Jacob "I will ..."
    - i don't make that happen, but I align with the identity He said I am 
    - drill conditional promises
        - look for caution promises first
        - look for command promises; require obidience
        - look for principal promise

> distractions will come and they all look good

6. time and season  
    - be student not victim
    - be validated victorian
    - **am i in the school** right now?
    - **what season** I am in right now?
    - am i taking note or complaining?
    - school of faith vs school of rejection
    - to be a **relection**
    - Ask the Lord for specific timing for each of prophetic words
    - ask **what you're known** for in heaven? **what do you love about me?**
        - Michelle got "nurturer"
            - She was offended at first since she received prophetic words to be queen, warrior, and impossible doer
            - Papa said go search those words if you didn't understand
                - after She search through the meaning, her life was changed



### Prophetic Processing
1. identity
- who's that He said you are
    - **what does the bible say about me that you agree with?**
    - you can't revoke identity Heaven says about you
- who's that He said He is; 
    - **what does the bible say about God that you agree with?**
- go after **your identity** first; be ready in **fullness** of yourself
2. promise
3. time & season
4. sphere of influence

> be a miner
