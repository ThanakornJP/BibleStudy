 x'mas - mark the end of waiting
 - there's a mark of no longer waiting because the Son has arrived. Whatever happen in every single person in this room that just as the Son was born, that mark sth new good news, and everything change from that night. Father, we ask for miracle all across this room. there'll be miracle all acoss this room, death cancellation, lost one coming home, resurrextion, lost being found, sick being heal, for anything your Son came to do will happen to us
 
  since Son of God came through you.
