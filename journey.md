### 1. commission | desire 
1 God's great commission, matt28:19-20, mark16:15-18 
1.1 prech `Gospel`
1.2 work `miracles` in Jesus's name to `testify` to gospel
1.3 `baptize` new believers
1.4 `disciple` those whoe receive Christ

> ref:https://messagemissions.com/the-4-commands-of-the-great-commission-remembering-our-forgotten-mission-by-jj-weller/

**Rom8:29**, For those He foreknew He also `predestined` to be conformed to the image of His son, so that He would be the `firstborn` among many brothers.

2 Desire
2.1 God - right thing at the right time (right hill)

**phi1:6**, I am sure of this, that He who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus

This is how He ransom our soul. Now we can autopilot **-- !!**
**prov3:5**, trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding

`Goal` God will work in your life to conform you into image of Christ where He doesn't have to come. He poured His love for us `first`

2.2 World and Flesh - do sth opposing/displeasing Him

`Goal` every minute, they have been trying to snatch you away from love of God, promises of God.  
`Only day-to-day relationship set you soul secure.` Even selected and anointed people got trapped; 
- Moses got tricked by his angel/annoyed
- Joshua got tricked by mercy
- David got tricked by lust
- Peter got tricked by fear
- Pharisee got tricked by tourment
- City ruler of hallucinated pigs got tricked by power

- Cz: getting trapped by anger for ego/bossy people that devours my soul. Thanks God, P'Tung pray for love with us.

### 2. faith | fear
1. Fear: no things shall overcome fear except faith, and likewise 

ex. cougar -
pray hard for 10 days
put faith forward 

2. Faith: 2 loaves, 5 fishes, rod & rock, rod & red sea, manna & quail, bread & reven, rock & giant, lion & a man, cloak & bleeding woman

##### type of faith
- dead faith, james 2:17, faith without works is dead. If your faith is real, you will produce fruit
- deomnic faith, james 2:19, they know Jesus is Son of God
- vain faith, mat7:21-23, only religious practice 
- saving faith
    - john3:16, God sent His beloved Son.
    - **eph2:8-10**, you are saved by `grace` through `faith`  
    - you ain't saved by previous good works, but you were made to do good works and point people to Christ. And, God prepared many good things for you to do. That's why we have so many journeys.  


**Pastor David Diga Hernandez**
For receiving Holy Spirit as our Lord, we get saved and received Him. Actually, you wouldn't be saved without Him in the first place. You're seeking but not finding bcoz `you're look for sth as if you don't have it.` you're looking for experience and miracle to validate a truth that you should already know by faith. So, `Faith is not what you ask for. It is in you so you got saved.`
`Our God is great and faithful` we stand on His promises

### 3. walk | disregard

**prov3:6**, Acknowledge him in all you ways, and He will make your path


### 4. struggle | stumble
### 5. fall away | fall still | fall for You

slow down 
take time 
breathe in 
he'll reveal what to come
take courage
stay steadfast my soul
he's in the waiting
hold onto hope
he never fail

sing praise my soul
find strength in joy
let his words lead you
don't forget His faithfullness 
he'll finish all 


6. breakthrough | pursue (Never get enough)


Paul - a trip to heaven for mission
- 2cor12:1-4, eph3:5, 2cor12:7
