# Reign
God not only gives us strategies to conquer, but He also does many great things such as reigning, ruling ,gathering, and administrating the things He provisions

พระเจ้าไม่ได้เพียงนำเราได้รับชัยชนะเพียงเท่านี้
--- 

Joshua 17:1 - Preferable firstborn son — feeling lot of love

Joshua 17:12, “Cannanites still live in that region” 
- Cannanites represent the existing tribe/team/man in the place God is about to give us the mission to conquer and posses.
- Different part of the land has different challenges. Some faces the ruin, some see aborigin challenges.
- Incomplete reign ( In real life, there is such situation where you don’t completely conquer ) 


### Problem with His grace
1. struggle to receive
> Joshua 17:12-13 - Even beloved son faces challenges —> God eventually makes us ready enough to possess
2. difficult to receive
> Joshua 19:47, "they neglected and took another instead" 
3. too small 
> Joshua 17:14,18, Why this little/small? —> God leads to another mountain to conquer, 
4. too big
> Joshua 19:9 - Judah territory was taken for Simeonites because it was more than they needed


Joshua 17:18
- “Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours” + “Though they are strong, you can drive them out” —> God knows our strength

### How long will you wait?
๋Joshua 18:3 - How long will you wait?

Joshua 18:6 - I will cast lots in the presense of the Lord

### Grace and communion 
He really needs to be with us; not for just His own sake, but to  watchguard for us over inheritance

1. high priest - Joshua 18:7
2. anointed leader - Joshua 19:49 


### Why the leader come last?
Why we often go before God?
