# Trauma root by P'Kai
Judging others 

--- 

### Brief
- trauma root leads us to judge people 
- High power in negative impact affecting ourselves and surrounding people 
- `heb12:15`
- too powerful to reign other free-will, and expectation eventually 
- Mostly, originated from **parent-children**
- consequence is under **harvesting rule**

### Effect
root = habit fed by ?
1. God - our nature/body is divine 
2. demon - our body is evil-doing 

### Trauma Sources
1. reaction of our own pain/sin 
2. judge by blaiming other
3. can't forgive 

### Example
1. Boy grew up from blaiming mom. He decided to retreat from his mom and model that woman. Then, he is afraid of that modeled woman then he expects a gap for every woman coming into his life, especially his wife. If his wife requested, he will take it as a complaint (negative) not request. Eventually, he falls away from his wife and complain his wife instead. 
- he harvested what he sow in his mom thru his wife

> if you judged your mom, your wife will come and do like your mom did to you so exactly that you must harvest what you sow. 

### How to resolve
1. repent on shown root 
2. forgiveness prayer thru declaration, the blood of Jesus Christ, and the Cross
3. blessing prayer for ourselves

### Note
1. no fruit without body; no body without root
