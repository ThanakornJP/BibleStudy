### Cz Framework, `Complimentary to P'Ladda`
1. รักษาความเชื่อ
2. เคาะ และ ขอ
3. ยืนหยัด และ รอคอย
(A)  
3.1 รักษาความชื่นชมยินดี **<-- discuss here**
3.2 ขยายความหวังใจให้คนรอบข้าง **<-- discuss**
`Romans 1:12`, that is, that `you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith`

(B)  
you may get caught in the situation of suffering and losing hope. `Have you ever got caught in the circumstance that you do not want to share your faith?`

For the `former`, `2 Cor4:16`, therefoer we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are `being renewed` day by day.

`isaiah 40:31`, but those who `hope in the Lord` will `renew their strength`. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and `not be faint.`

For the `latter`, CZZZZZ

`Billy Graham`, our faith becomes stronger as we express it; a growing faith is a sharing faith.

`mark 16:15`, go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation
`matthew 4:20`, I will send you out to fish for people

*** `1 peter 3:15-16`, Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.

### Hope vs Faith
1 corinthians 13:13, now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.

Faith
- confidence in what we hope for. 
- a complete trust in something. 
- involves `intellectual assent`(believing sth to be true) to a set of facts, and trust in those facts
- `intellectual assent` incorporate `mind` level
- Ex. faith in Jesus Christ = completely trust Jesus 

### Soul vs Spirit
`Hebrews 4:12`, for the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piecing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart 

Through `soul`, people who allow their soul to control their life is never at rest. Through the soul (senses and feelings), I am in contact with people. They are always in *unrest* because of what other people think and say about him. I live according to my senses, understanding which is so earthly.

Through `body`, my body is used to serve this world. `Genesis3:?`,

Through `spirit`, I am in contact with God. Due to the nature of our body, spirit is filled with that which is of this world with the result that I have little or no contact with God. Go make our spirits alive so that God can speak to us. *Live for Him, then we find rest for our souls*

###### Left or Right
`Isaiah 53:12`, Therefore, I will divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong, because He poured out `His soul unto death` and Hw was numbered with the transgressors, and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transfressors.

Ex. "forgive the person who sins against you seven times seventy each day" 
- for soulish (earthly) - make sense to human reasoning. you who comply will mostly make plans as to what you should do with such a person, and perhaps seek opinion of family or friends. 
- for spirit, let God's Word pierce and divide between you are absorbing through your senses, especially our feelings. And, receive heavenly wisdom through your spirit

###### Transformation
`Immanuel`, `Gospel`, `Crucification`, `Ascension`, so called grace or salvation, are meant to change this relationship so that we all become spiritual and heavenly instead of soulish and earthly. Consequently, the result is life of faith instead of a life according to human understanding

###### Be spiritual minded
People who had only sense for things of men will spare yourself and your own. This is direction in which people have exercised their senses and have gained understanding.

`Satan has access` to earthly soul, and all soulish are unrest.

`James 3:17-19`, spiritual wisdom, wisdom that is from above is first and foremost pure.

> Hold fast to the Word against our own human reasoning and present our body in the service of God. Then, our soul, which is earthly and restless, is poured out. Finally, we become spiritually minded and enter into  rest in God



### Hope Type, เราต้องแยก hope ออกเป็น
1. hope that is in Him
2. hope that is in our flesh
3. hope that is in yoke


### 3.1 รักษาความชื่นชมยินดี
`เราเผชิญกับคำท้าทายกับความเชื่อของเราได้อย่างไร`
`proverbs13:12`, **hope deferred** makes the heart sick, but a **desire fulfilled** is a tree of life

เรารับมือกับคำถามที่ท้าทายได้ยังไง เช่น พระเจ้าไม่เห็นทำเลย พระเจ้าไม่เห็นช่วยเลย


### 3.2 ขยายความหวังใจให้คนรอบข้าง

เราเผชิญกับคำท้าทายกับความเชื่อของเราได้อย่างไร
proverbs13:12, hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life


### all believes are in us to bring Him glory
เราถามพระเจ้าหรือยัง อธ ขอสำเร็จไหม เป็นพยานเท็จไหม

### Rule (10 commandments) and consequence: False witness 
`exodus 20:16`, you shall not bear false winess against your neighbor
`proverbs 19:5`, a false witness will not go unpunised, and he who breathe out lies will not escape. `proverbs 19:9`, a false witness will not go unpunished and he who speaks lies shall perish.

### white lie (falsehood) vs lie (false witness)
exodus, `moses x pharaoh`, he misled bcoz he was sent to deliver Israel not to lead them to worship
`peter x officer`, he denied bcoz he was chosen to follow Jesus
genesis20, `abraham x abimelech`, he tricked bcoz of his anxiety
joshua2:1-7, `rahab x officer`, 

### key to note, 
`proverbs13:12`, hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life

### Resolution
1. God's forginess
`1 john 1:9`, if we confess our sins, he is faithfull and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness

2. God's grace to stop lying
`2 corinthians 12:9`, each time he said, "my grace is all you need. my power works best in weakness." So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.
